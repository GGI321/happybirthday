        <p>today is ur birthday and i have really thought of how exactly to make u feel special as i cant let ur birthday just pass without putting a smile on ur face</p>
        <p>i want to cease this opportunity to tell u how much u mean to me, how much of a treasure u re to me, how mmuch of my existance u consume</p>
        <p>imay not have made ur day as bright as i have wanted, but im sure that the sun it self wont smile if u re not smilling</p>

      <p>Our story is one of love, connection, and resilience. You are not just my better halfâ€”you are the missing piece that makes me whole. Even though miles now separate us, my heart remains with you, beating with every thought of you. Distance may test us, but it will never define us or diminish what we share. You are my everything, and no matter where we are, my love for you will bridge any distance. Always. </p>
